            <h2>Key Features of R.A.I.N.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Real-Time Humidity Monitoring:</span> The system displays the current soil moisture level, categorized as *Dry*, *Moist*, or *Wet*. The display color changes dynamically to indicate the soil's condition at a glance.</li>
                <li><span>Threshold Management:</span> Users can set customizable moisture thresholds for the system, such as *Dry Max* and *Moist Max*. This feature ensures that irrigation is triggered or paused based on real-time data from the HydroSense Sensors.</li>
                <li><span>Irrigation Modes:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Auto Mode:</strong> Automatically starts and stops irrigation based on soil moisture and preset thresholds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manual Mode:</strong> Gives users the option to manually control irrigation by pressing the "Irrigate" button.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span>Firebase Integration:</span> R.A.I.N. uses Firebase Realtime Database to provide instant updates to all connected devices, ensuring real-time synchronization and control.</li>
                <li><span>Responsive Design:</span> The R.A.I.N. system works seamlessly across multiple devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, ensuring access from anywhere.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Set Thresholds?</h2>
            <p>Setting appropriate moisture thresholds is essential for different types of plants, as each plant has its own water needs. By defining specific thresholds for soil moisture, you ensure that your plants receive the optimal amount of water, promoting healthy growth and sustainability.</p>
