        <div class="content-section key-features">
            <ul>
                <li><span>Real-Time Humidity Monitoring:</span> The system displays the current soil moisture level, categorized as *Dry*, *Moist*, or *Wet*. The display color changes dynamically to indicate the soil's condition at a glance.</li>
                <li><span>Threshold Management:</span> Users can set customizable moisture thresholds for the system, such as *Dry Max* and *Moist Max*. This feature ensures that irrigation is triggered or paused based on real-time data from the HydroSense Sensors.</li>
                <li><span>Irrigation Modes:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Auto Mode:</strong> Automatically starts and stops irrigation based on soil moisture and preset thresholds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manual Mode:</strong> Gives users the option to manually control irrigation by pressing the "Irrigate" button.</li>

                </li>
                <li><span>Firebase Integration:</span> R.A.I.N. uses Firebase Realtime Database to provide instant updates to all connected devices, ensuring real-time synchronization and control.</li>
                <li><span>Responsive Design:</span> The R.A.I.N. system works seamlessly across multiple devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, ensuring access from anywhere.</li>

        </div>

        <button class="collapsible">Why Set Thresholds?</button>
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>Setting appropriate moisture thresholds is essential for different types of plants, as each plant has its own water needs. By defining specific thresholds for soil moisture, you ensure that your plants receive the optimal amount of water, promoting healthy growth and sustainability.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible">Research</button>
        <div class="content-section research-questions">
            <p>The development of R.A.I.N. (Remote Automated Irrigation Network) is driven by the need to address gaps in efficient, automated irrigation systems that optimize water usage. The primary problem this product aims to solve is the inefficiency of traditional irrigation methods, which often result in either overwatering or underwatering plants. This problem not only affects plant health but also leads to wasteful water usage. By implementing a system that automatically adjusts irrigation based on real-time soil moisture data, R.A.I.N. ensures plants receive just the right amount of water, thus improving water conservation efforts.</p>
            <p>The main objective of R.A.I.N. is to provide an automated, smart irrigation solution that reduces human intervention while maintaining healthy plants. Key goals include setting customizable moisture thresholds, integrating Firebase for real-time updates across devices, and ensuring the system is responsive on both desktop and mobile platforms. To achieve these goals, it is necessary to design both hardware (such as the AquaValve and HydroSense Sensors) and software (mobile/web interface and Firebase integration) components that work seamlessly together.</p>
            <p>R.A.I.N. is innovative in its approach because it integrates real-time soil moisture sensing with automated irrigation control through WiFi, offering a level of convenience and precision not found in traditional irrigation systems. The systemâ€™s use of Firebase for real-time synchronization across multiple devices further enhances its functionality, allowing users to monitor and control irrigation from anywhere at any time. This approach sets R.A.I.N. apart from existing irrigation solutions that typically require manual adjustments or lack real-time data integration.</p>
            <p>The feasibility of developing R.A.I.N. is very positive. With current technologies, such as WiFi-controlled solenoid valves, soil moisture sensors, and Firebase for real-time data synchronization, this project is entirely achievable. The hardware and software components are available, and the development process is well within the scope of modern technological capabilities, making R.A.I.N. a highly feasible project with potential for wide application in both personal and commercial irrigation systems.</p>
